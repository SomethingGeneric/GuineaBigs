# GuineaBigs
Minecraft Fabric mod to add Guinea Pigs :D

## Warning! Still in very early development

## I want to test it anyway!
Ok, you can do one of two things:
* Build it locally: `./gradlew build` (assuming you have a JDK 21 or higher installed)
* Download `Artifacts.zip` from a recent GitHub actions run (make sure to pick the latest from `master` branch)

Either way, you should then have a JAR file you can drop into your client with Fabric installed for 1.21.1
